# Ghost Protocol üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeBlooded


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rohit M R - CUSAT
- Member 2: [Shenes Eapen Koshy] - CUSAT

### Project Description
Ghost Protocol is a creepy prank program that simulates paranormal activity on your computer by moving the mouse randomly, typing eerie messages, showing ghostly popups, playing scary videos and audios, and more ‚Äî all without user interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who wants a peaceful, quiet computer anyway? Not you, right? That‚Äôs why we turned your PC into a digital haunted house ‚Äî complete with a mouse that acts like it‚Äôs possessed, creepy messages typing themselves (because privacy is overrated), random ghostly glitches that‚Äôll make you question your sanity, and surprise jumpscares to keep your heart rate up. Because honestly, why settle for calm when you can have chaos ‚Äî spooky, supernatural chaos?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution? A digital poltergeist ‚Äî basically a mischievous little ghost trapped in your computer, ready to prank you by hijacking your mouse, typing spooky messages you didn‚Äôt ask for, popping up creepy alerts like it owns the place, and blasting scary sounds and videos just to mess with your nerves. It‚Äôs like having a haunted house inside your PC ‚Äî without the creepy basement or the weird smells, just pure, unadulterated digital terror‚Ä¶ with a side of laughs.
