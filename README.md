# Ghost Protocol üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeBlooded


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rohit M R - CUSAT
- Member 2: [Shenes Eapen Koshy] - CUSAT

### Project Description
Ghost Protocol is a creepy prank program that simulates paranormal activity on your computer by moving the mouse randomly, typing eerie messages, showing ghostly popups, playing scary videos and audios, and more ‚Äî all without user interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who wants a peaceful, quiet computer anyway? Not you, right? That‚Äôs why we turned your PC into a digital haunted house ‚Äî complete with a mouse that acts like it‚Äôs possessed, creepy messages typing themselves (because privacy is overrated), random ghostly glitches that‚Äôll make you question your sanity, and surprise jumpscares to keep your heart rate up. Because honestly, why settle for calm when you can have chaos ‚Äî spooky, supernatural chaos?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution? A digital poltergeist ‚Äî basically a mischievous little ghost trapped in your computer, ready to prank you by hijacking your mouse, typing spooky messages you didn‚Äôt ask for, popping up creepy alerts like it owns the place, and blasting scary sounds and videos just to mess with your nerves. It‚Äôs like having a haunted house inside your PC ‚Äî without the creepy basement or the weird smells, just pure, unadulterated digital terror‚Ä¶ with a side of laughs.

Extract this at C:/ffmpeg

Add C:ffmpeg/bin as new path in System Variables in Environment Variables


Then at our main python scripts directory:

pip install pyautogui

pip install tkinter  

pip install pillow

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

Name:Error displayers, mouse movement and program close modal.
This picture shows the presence of the modal that can stop the ghost from functioning. It also shows one of the creepy pop up messages that the ghost displays to scare you. It also shows the terminal that logs the details of these. Mouse is moving and scrolling is taking place, but that obviously won't be displayed in the scrnshot(This was the result of running the python script, not the exe file,although both are almost the same)


![Image 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dksroyuod/image/upload/v1754696138/Screenshot_2025-08-09_050446_rgyxyw.png)
Name:The modal pop up when .exe file is run (may take a few seconds)
This picture shows the modal that comes up that sort of decieves the user into beleiving that the application is safe to use and fun.

Name: Starting of chaos
When the user clicks yes for the previous image's popup, then this small intro video starts to load and fades out, then the chaos begins

### Project Demo
# Video
![Demo video](https://youtu.be/ZOnT0SUDiVs)
Demonstrates the starting of the exe file... the Valak's intro... random mouse movement, circular movement, zigzag movement, random clicking (because notepad was open but suddenly it went behind the file manager tab indicating that file manager tab was clicked), automatically typing messages (in the notepad it started typing messages, fyi : it was really hard to open the notepad just to show you guys that the typing works). Additional jumpscares and sfx to scare you.... Random popups showing spooky messages etc....

# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]

## Team Contributions
- Rohit M R : Video creations for jumpscares during startup, clicking effect, automatic typing
- Shenes: Video creations for jumpscares, scrolling, mouse movement, sfx
